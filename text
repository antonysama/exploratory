  OSLO, March 9 Norway's $830-billion sovereign wealth fund pulled out of 27 firms with links to coal last year as part of a policy to combat climate change, prompting campaigners to urge other big investors to follow suit.\n The fund, the world's biggest, also said it sold holdings in 11 companies because of concerns about the destruction of tropical forests to make way for palm oil plantations or fast-growing trees used for paper and pulp.\nIt did not name the companies it dropped.\n                  Norway's parliament agreed last year to make the fund sell out of companies that get more than 30 percent of their business from coal. The fund is also limiting investments in firms with high greenhouse gas emissions.\n                  \"Big money is now starting to move away from fossil fuels,\"  Martin Norman, director of Greenpeace's Nordic Finance Campaign, said in a statement, adding that \"others should follow\".\n                  Norway's fund, built up from the country's oil and gas production revenues, said it sold stakes in 11 companies involved in mining coal for power production and 16 power generators using coal.

time to ACT, says the Coal Association of Canada (CAC).\nThe association has launched its “ACT for the Future” initiative and was in Stony Plain speaking with residents and coal industry employees about the Climate Leadership Plan on March 1.\nThe meeting was one of several hosted by the CAC across the province in communities where the impact of the provincial government’s plan to eliminate coal-fired power generation plants will be felt the most.\nThe meeting’s emphasis was on the importance of fully understanding the issues and getting answers on the future of individuals and communities relying on the coal industry.\nWithin Parkland County, hundreds of jobs at the Sundance and Keephills plants will be impacted if the plan is followed through to phase out coal and transition to more renewable energy and natural gas generation by 2030.\nTransCanada Corp. announced this week it plans to terminate its agreements with three coal-fired plants within Alberta. This impacts the Sundance A and B plants in Parkland County and the Sheerness power plant near Hanna. The company reported there are high costs associated with carbon-dioxide emissions from the plants, and those costs are expected to increase further over the remaining term of the agreements. TransCanada’s contract with Sundance A wasn’t set to expire until 2017, and Sundance B and Sheerness contracts were set to end in 2020. No new timelines have been confirmed yet.\nWith the plants set for retirement, Parkland County Mayor Rod Shaigec said this will mean the county will be taking a huge hit financially. The county is currently receiving just over $12 million a year in tax revenue from Sundance, Keephills and other mining activity.\nMore importantly, he said, is the impact it will have on employment. He noted re-employment is made even more difficult for many of the individuals affected, as the majority of them don’t have post-secondary education and are over 50 years old.\n“There’s going to be limited opportunity for them once these plants are phased out, and that’s going to take money out of the community as well,” Shaigec said, adding many will likely leave the area.\nRobin Campbell, the president of the Coal Association of Canada and former West Yellowhead MLA, said there has been a sense of uncertainty among the people in each of the communities — from the loss of employment to real estate values.\n“The families and the people that work in the industry really feel that they’re being short-changed by this,” he stated. “Some of these people have been working at the mines or at the plants for quite a while and are well-established in their communities and are now looking at maybe having to move their families.”\nThe CAC wants to see money invested in research technology to continue improving coal technology.\n“We’re not arguing climate change and we’re not arguing greenhouse gas, but we are saying that over the years you’ve seen a very positive transition in coal technology,” Campbell stated. “You look at the plants around Wabamun, the air quality is good. People in those mines take pride in that.”\nAlbertans, and Canadians, have the ability to take the lead in research and technology and providing the world with clean coal technology that could help many underdeveloped countries, he said.\n“It’s a good, stable, affordable energy source in the province,” Campbell said of the 37 billion tons of coal found in Alberta.\nHe added it is “a very viable part of the Alberta economy,” which supplies affordable power to residents — especially those on a fixed income.\nWhile there has been a push for renewable energy, there is uncertainty as to what it would cost, Campbell said.\n“Residents, small businesses — (and) right now some of them are hanging on by a thread — can’t afford any hiccups in their utility bills,” he stated.\nAlbertans will be paying the cost to phase out coal — and its not going to be cheap, Campbell emphasized.\nThe plan doesn’t bode well for communities such as Forestburg and Hanna he said.\n“A lot of these communities are based on the fact that the power plant is there and the mine is there. Without that, some of these communities could really suffer,” Campbell said.\nLocally, Stony Plain Mayor William Choy said there are about 300 jobs related to the coal industry and another 400 directly related. Changes will mean finding a way to re-employ these people.\n“It’s a lot of fear of what’s going to happen in the future,” Choy said of those whose jobs could be impacted.\n“The question still out there is why? We already have a climate change plan in place by the federal government and agreed upon by the provincial government where it calls for decommissioning of older plants. So why cost taxpayers billions of dollars to accelerate that?”\nShaigec noted there is recognition of the need for industries and individuals to do a better job of minimizing their environmental footprint. But when it comes to the phase-out plan, all the consequences need to be considered.\n“There’s going to be considerable factors that I believe haven’t been considered, and (there needs to be) dialogue with all the stakeholders,” Shaigec stated. “Make everybody aware of what the financial costs and implications are going to be on individuals, families, businesses and all levels of government as well.”\nThe CAC is asking coal workers, municipalities, businesses and residents to voice their concerns to their MLA, the minister of environment and Premier Rachel Notley.\n“The government has to sit down with coal mining communities and talk to them and explain what the plan is and how the workers fit into those plans,” Campbell said. “It’s about getting answers for hard-working Albertans that are being penalized because they work in coal.”\nmlove@postmedia.com\nTwitter:

  * Raises doubts about ability to continue as a going concern\n * Fails to pay $71.1 mln in interest, enters 30-day grace period\n* Shares drop 46 pct   (Adds background, updates share prices)\nBy Jessica DiNapoli\nMarch 16 Peabody Energy Corp, the largest U.S. coal producer, may have to seek bankruptcy protection, the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, citing poor economies in countries that import coal and other factors battering the coal industry.\nIts shares fell 46 percent to $2.16.\nFalling demand for coal, tougher environmental controls and cheaper natural gas have pushed several big coal miners, including Arch Coal Inc, into bankruptcy in the past year.\nPeabody, which flagged the possibility of bankruptcy under the \"risk factors\" section of a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said it had decided to skip $71.1 million in interest payments, kicking off a 30-day grace period. (1.usa.gov/22jEJnJ)\nThe company, said there was \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern. It cited stagnating economic growth in major coal importers and the potential for additional regulatory requirements imposed on producers.\n                  Coal prices, which hit historic highs above $200 per tonne in 2008, now trade at around $40 a tonne. Goldman Sachs Group has said coal would never gain enough traction to lift it out of its slump.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday forecast that this year will be the first year that natural gas fired generation exceeds coal generation on an annual basis. About a third of U.S. electricity comes from natural gas, versus 32 percent from coal and 19 percent from nuclear. As recently as 2000, coal accounted for about half.\nSt. Louis-based Peabody, which employed 7,600 people on Dec. 31, said it was also looking into other sources of capital to support its needs for cash and keep it in compliance with creditors. Bond exchanges, cost cuts and waivers to its credit agreements are some of its options, the company said.\nPeabody owns interest in 26 mines in the United States and Australia, with about three-quarters of its output going to U.S. electricity generators, according to its filing. It has trading and business offices in Australia, China, and India, among others.\n                  China, where coal imports have slowed to support domestic producers, represented 7.1 percent of total Peabody sales last year.\nOn March 11, Peabody reported $900 million of cash and cash equivalents. It had reported $261.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at Dec. 31, and then, in February, borrowed the maximum amount available under its revolving credit line, about $945 million.\nThe company said in a statement its auditors have concluded its current financial path may not be sustainable and \"may result in an acceleration of our debt obligations.\"\nPeabody had total debt of $6.3 billion at the end of 2015.\n                  Peabody's lenders are pushing it to restructure its debt through bankruptcy.\nPeabody's efforts to raise funds through asset sales hit a roadblock last month. A deal to raise $358 million in cash by selling coal mines in New Mexico and Colorado was temporarily shelved after the buyer failed to secure financing.\nPeabody's shares have crashed from their record high of more than $1,300 in 2008 to $2.36 on Wednesday morning. Its market capitalization was $74 million Wednesday, down from over $20 billion in 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nFellow coal miner Foresight Energy LP said on Tuesday it may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy if it does not reach an out-of-court restructuring agreement with its lenders.\nPatriot Coal Corp, which was spun off from Peabody in 2007,  filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2015, just 18 months after emerging from its previous Chapter 11.\nOther coal miners that have filed for protection include Walter Energy and Alpha Natural Resources Inc .\nCloud Peak Energy Inc, Consol Energy Inc, Foresight and Westmoreland Coal Co were all lower by about 1 percent in midday trading on Wednesday.

  * Raises doubts about ability to continue as a going concern\n * Fails to pay $71.1 mln in interest, enters 30-day grace period\n* Shares drop 46 pct   (Adds background, updates share prices)\nBy Jessica DiNapoli\nMarch 16 Peabody Energy Corp, the largest U.S. coal producer, may have to seek bankruptcy protection, the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, citing poor economies in countries that import coal and other factors battering the coal industry.\nIts shares fell 46 percent to $2.16.\nFalling demand for coal, tougher environmental controls and cheaper natural gas have pushed several big coal miners, including Arch Coal Inc, into bankruptcy in the past year.\nPeabody, which flagged the possibility of bankruptcy under the \"risk factors\" section of a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said it had decided to skip $71.1 million in interest payments, kicking off a 30-day grace period. (1.usa.gov/22jEJnJ)\nThe company, said there was \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern. It cited stagnating economic growth in major coal importers and the potential for additional regulatory requirements imposed on producers.\n                  Coal prices, which hit historic highs above $200 per tonne in 2008, now trade at around $40 a tonne. Goldman Sachs Group has said coal would never gain enough traction to lift it out of its slump.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday forecast that this year will be the first year that natural gas fired generation exceeds coal generation on an annual basis. About a third of U.S. electricity comes from natural gas, versus 32 percent from coal and 19 percent from nuclear. As recently as 2000, coal accounted for about half.\nSt. Louis-based Peabody, which employed 7,600 people on Dec. 31, said it was also looking into other sources of capital to support its needs for cash and keep it in compliance with creditors. Bond exchanges, cost cuts and waivers to its credit agreements are some of its options, the company said.\nPeabody owns interest in 26 mines in the United States and Australia, with about three-quarters of its output going to U.S. electricity generators, according to its filing. It has trading and business offices in Australia, China, and India, among others.\n                  China, where coal imports have slowed to support domestic producers, represented 7.1 percent of total Peabody sales last year.\nOn March 11, Peabody reported $900 million of cash and cash equivalents. It had reported $261.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at Dec. 31, and then, in February, borrowed the maximum amount available under its revolving credit line, about $945 million.\nThe company said in a statement its auditors have concluded its current financial path may not be sustainable and \"may result in an acceleration of our debt obligations.\"\nPeabody had total debt of $6.3 billion at the end of 2015.\n                  Peabody's lenders are pushing it to restructure its debt through bankruptcy.\nPeabody's efforts to raise funds through asset sales hit a roadblock last month. A deal to raise $358 million in cash by selling coal mines in New Mexico and Colorado was temporarily shelved after the buyer failed to secure financing.\nPeabody's shares have crashed from their record high of more than $1,300 in 2008 to $2.36 on Wednesday morning. Its market capitalization was $74 million Wednesday, down from over $20 billion in 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nFellow coal miner Foresight Energy LP said on Tuesday it may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy if it does not reach an out-of-court restructuring agreement with its lenders.\nPatriot Coal Corp, which was spun off from Peabody in 2007,  filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2015, just 18 months after emerging from its previous Chapter 11.\nOther coal miners that have filed for protection include Walter Energy and Alpha Natural Resources Inc .\nCloud Peak Energy Inc, Consol Energy Inc, Foresight and Westmoreland Coal Co were all lower by about 1 percent in midday trading on Wednesday.

Shenhua president, details about Shenhua's renewable energy strategy)\n BEIJING, March 30 China's Shenhua Group is in talks with leading Chinese nuclear developers on taking stakes in domestic nuclear projects, as the country's biggest coal producer diversifies into cleaner forms of energy, Shenhua President Zhang Yuzhuo said on Wednesday.\nShenhua Group, state-owned parent of Shanghai and Hong Kong-listed China Shenhua Energy, has been cutting coal production in a bid to shore up prices, which have plunged as a result of declining demand and a huge domestic supply glut.\nThe nuclear companies Shenhua is in talks with include China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) and China General Nuclear Power Corp (CGN), Zhang said.\nShenhua Energy saw its net profit fall 56.9 percent in 2015.  It produced 280.9 million tonnes of coal over the year, down 8.4 percent on 2014, and expects output to fall a further 0.3 percent this year, it said in its results filing last week.\n                  Zhang said the company was dealing with a transformation in China's energy structure in which coal use would decline. The company has built 6.2 gigawatts of wind power capacity and 182 megawatts of solar power and is developing geothermal energy.\n\"Among big Chinese companies, when it comes to developing clean and renewable energies, we are not lagging behind at all,\" he said.\n                  \"We are hoping that in 20 or 30 years, we can bring down the costs of non-fossil fuel energies and at the same time raise the scale of construction, and during this process, allow fossil fuels and non-fossil fuels to be harmonised and provide mutual support,\" he added.\nHe said the company was also at the forefront of efforts to make coal cleaner. It has installed low-emission technology at all its 22 coal-fired power generators in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, amounting to 10 gigawatts of capacity, and had made progress on commercialising technologies aimed at capturing climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions.\n                  Zhang was speaking at a ceremony to mark 20 years of cooperation between China and the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\"A few years ago we said China coal might peak, and I believe it might now have peaked,\" Fatih Birol, director of the IEA, told Reuters.\nSun Longde, vice president of China's top oil and gas producer PetroChina, told the conference his company was forecasting the country's energy consumption would peak by 2035, adding the share of coal in China's total energy mix would eventually fall to around a third, from around two thirds now.

Shenhua president, details about Shenhua's renewable energy strategy)\n BEIJING, March 30 China's Shenhua Group is in talks with leading Chinese nuclear developers on taking stakes in domestic nuclear projects, as the country's biggest coal producer diversifies into cleaner forms of energy, Shenhua President Zhang Yuzhuo said on Wednesday.\nShenhua Group, state-owned parent of Shanghai and Hong Kong-listed China Shenhua Energy, has been cutting coal production in a bid to shore up prices, which have plunged as a result of declining demand and a huge domestic supply glut.\nThe nuclear companies Shenhua is in talks with include China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) and China General Nuclear Power Corp (CGN), Zhang said.\nShenhua Energy saw its net profit fall 56.9 percent in 2015.  It produced 280.9 million tonnes of coal over the year, down 8.4 percent on 2014, and expects output to fall a further 0.3 percent this year, it said in its results filing last week.\n                  Zhang said the company was dealing with a transformation in China's energy structure in which coal use would decline. The company has built 6.2 gigawatts of wind power capacity and 182 megawatts of solar power and is developing geothermal energy.\n\"Among big Chinese companies, when it comes to developing clean and renewable energies, we are not lagging behind at all,\" he said.\n                  \"We are hoping that in 20 or 30 years, we can bring down the costs of non-fossil fuel energies and at the same time raise the scale of construction, and during this process, allow fossil fuels and non-fossil fuels to be harmonised and provide mutual support,\" he added.\nHe said the company was also at the forefront of efforts to make coal cleaner. It has installed low-emission technology at all its 22 coal-fired power generators in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, amounting to 10 gigawatts of capacity, and had made progress on commercialising technologies aimed at capturing climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions.\n                  Zhang was speaking at a ceremony to mark 20 years of cooperation between China and the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\"A few years ago we said China coal might peak, and I believe it might now have peaked,\" Fatih Birol, director of the IEA, told Reuters.\nSun Longde, vice president of China's top oil and gas producer PetroChina, told the conference his company was forecasting the country's energy consumption would peak by 2035, adding the share of coal in China's total energy mix would eventually fall to around a third, from around two thirds now.

analyst.

changes to text)\n By Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, April 4 - Coal's bright start to the year in Asia is fading amid the gloom of weak demand across the region's top importers and still too much supply from top producers.\nThe benchmark Newcastle weekly coal index ended at $51.13 a tonne on April 1, down from its high so far this year of $52.59, reached on March 11.\nThat peak capped a rally of 11 percent from the almost 10-year low of $47.37 a tonne plumbed in the week to Jan. 21, but it now appears it was nothing more than a false dawn.\nCoal was most likely the beneficiary of better sentiment towards commodities in general that saw strong rallies in iron ore and crude oil in recent weeks, which have also petered out.\nBut while there may be some positive fundamentals in other commodities markets, with tentative signs of a recovery in China's vast manufacturing sector, there is no silver lining in sight for coal.\nChina's official Purchasing Managers' Index expanded for the first time in 9 months in March, rising to 50.2, up from February's 49 to be just over the 50-line that demarcates expansion from contraction in the manufacturing sector.\nWhile this may herald better times ahead for sectors such as iron ore, steel, aluminium, copper and crude oil, the joy is unlikely to be shared by coal.\nChina aims to keep the rise in its total energy use to just 0.9 percent in 2016, the same rate as 2015, the National Energy Administration said on April 1.\nFor coal, the important part is that the plan also calls for coal's share of that total to be cut to 63 percent from last year's 64 percent.\nIf a cut of 1 percentage point doesn't sound that significant, its worth noting that China's total energy consumption is about 4.34 billion tonnes of coal equivalent, meaning 1 percentage point is about 43.4 million tonnes.\nWhile the lower coal consumption is most likely to result in lower domestic output, if it was taken from imports, it would amount to roughly one-fifth of 2015's total imports of 204.06 million tonnes.\n                  China plans to shut 60 million tonnes of domestic coal output this year, and 500 million tonnes in total over the next five years.\nHowever, this isn't necessarily bullish for imports, as even cuts of this magnitude will still leave sufficient domestic coal to meet demand, leaving imports to compete on a price basis in specific markets, particularly those in China's industrial southeast.\nIn the first two months of this year, China's coal imports have dropped 10.2 percent, a slower rate of decline than the almost 30-percent decline experienced in 2015.\nBut a look at the details show major coal exporters Australia and Indonesia are struggling to ship the fuel to the world's top buyer.\nImports from Australia are down almost 18 percent in the first two months from the same period a year ago, while those from Indonesia have slumped 21.7 percent.\nThe surprise winner in China so far this year has been North Korea, which has boosted its shipments to its neighbour by 26.9 percent and is now just behind Indonesia as the third-biggest supplier.\n                  As with anything to do with North Korea, there is possibly a political element in these purchases, but no matter the motivation the fact remains that China's main suppliers are being squeezed by a competitor they know very little about.\n\nIMPORTS DOWN IN TOP BUYERS\nOutside of China there is little reason for coal exporters to be optimistic, with imports by No.2 buyer India still trending lower despite a modest uptick in February.\nIndia imported 16.79 million tonnes in February, up 1.7 percent from the same month a year ago and the first increase in eight months.\nBut given that state producer Coal India has recently had to scale back mining activity as consumption growth has been weaker than supply growth, it's likely that the trend toward lower imports will persist.\n                  Japan's total coal imports rose 1.2 percent in February from a year earlier, but purchases by the third-ranked importer were down 1.9 percent for the first two months of the year.\nSouth Korea, Asia's fourth-biggest coal importer, saw its overseas purchases drop 17.6 percent in February from a year earlier, and they are down 6.5 percent for the first two months of the year.\nWith purchases down in the first two months of the year in Asia's four-biggest importers, it's clear that there is no demand justification for a sustained price rally in coal prices.\nThere are some longer-term positives for coal in the region, such as the start of construction of a 2,000-megawatt coal-fired plant in Indonesia and plans for more new units in countries such as Japan.\nBut these are several years away from coming on line, meaning coal exporters have to deal with the current weak market while hoping for future growth in demand.\nIndonesia remains the main adjuster of market balance, with output in the Southeast Asian nation expected to drop to about 350 million tonnes in 2016 from 391 million, according to the energy ministry.\nThe industry expects exports to fall to less than 300 million tonnes this year from 330-360 million tonnes last year, as mines remain under pressure from low prices.\nAustralia's coal shipments also appear to be easing, with Newcastle Port, the world's largest coal-export harbour, reporting 24.72 million tonnes of coal exported in the first two months of the year, a 5.7-percent drop from the same period in 2015.\nThe overall picture from the coal sector is one of weak demand from importers, and continuing supply adjustments from exporters.\nWhile this rules out any price rally, it may allow for prices to stabilise assuming exporters continue to adjust supply to balance the market.\n(Editing by Joseph
